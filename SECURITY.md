- **Dependency Updates**: Keep dependencies updated
- **Error Handling**: Avoid information disclosure in error messages
- **Authentication**: Implement proper authentication if applicable

### Security Best Practices

#### For Contributors

1. **Code Review**: All code changes should be reviewed for security issues
2. **Dependency Scanning**: Regularly scan for vulnerable dependencies
3. **Input Sanitization**: Always sanitize and validate inputs
4. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling without information disclosure
5. **Testing**: Include security tests in your test suite

#### For Users

1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest stable version
2. **Environment Security**: Secure your development and production environments
3. **API Keys**: Store API keys securely and rotate them regularly
4. **Data Validation**: Validate all data before processing
5. **Monitoring**: Monitor for unusual activity or errors

### Security Features

#### Current Security Measures

- **Input Validation**: All strategy inputs are validated
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling without information disclosure
- **Data Sanitization**: Market data is validated and sanitized
- **Dependency Management**: Pinned dependency versions for security

#### Planned Security Enhancements

- **Automated Security Scanning**: Integration with security scanning tools
- **Dependency Vulnerability Monitoring**: Automated alerts for vulnerable dependencies
- **Code Signing**: Digital signatures for releases
- **Security Documentation**: Detailed security documentation

### Disclosure Policy

#### Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Private Reporting**: Vulnerabilities are reported privately first
2. **Timeline**: We work with reporters to establish disclosure timelines
3. **Credit**: We give credit to security researchers who report vulnerabilities
4. **Coordination**: We coordinate with affected parties when necessary

#### Public Disclosure

- **Timeline**: Vulnerabilities are disclosed within 90 days of discovery
- **Format**: Clear, actionable information is provided
- **Patches**: Security patches are released simultaneously
- **Communication**: Clear communication about impact and mitigation

### Security Contacts

- **Security Email**: [INSERT SECURITY EMAIL]
- **PGP Key**: [INSERT PGP KEY IF AVAILABLE]
- **Response Team**: Core maintainers and security volunteers

### Security Acknowledgments

We would like to thank the security researchers and community members who have helped improve the security of Composer Parser through responsible disclosure.
