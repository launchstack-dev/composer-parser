## Features

### ‚úÖ Currently Implemented

#### Core Parser Operators
- **`if`** - Conditional logic with then/else branches

## Usage

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Use this software at your own risk. The authors accept no liability for any financial losses or damages resulting from the use of this code.**

### Basic Backtest

1. **Prepare your symphony JSON file** (see `symphony.json` for example)
2. **Prepare ground truth CSV** (optional, for validation)
3. **Run the backtest:**
   ```bash
   python3 backtester.py
   ```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** Always test with small amounts and understand that this experimental software may produce incorrect results. Never rely solely on this software for trading decisions.

### Configuration

Edit the configuration section in `backtester.py`:

```python
# --- Configuration ---
SYMPHONY_FILE_PATH = 'symphony.json'
GROUND_TRUTH_FILE_PATH = 'composer-tickers.csv'
START_DATE = '2022-01-01'
END_DATE = '2024-01-01'
INITIAL_CAPITAL = 100000.0
```

## File Structure

```
composer-parser/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backtester.py          # Main backtesting application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ composer_parser.py     # Symphony JSON parser
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ symphony.json          # Example strategy definition
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ composer-tickers.csv   # Ground truth data (optional)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt       # Python dependencies
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md             # This file
```

## Symphony JSON Format

The symphony JSON follows Composer.trade's Lisp-like syntax converted to JSON:

```json
[
  "defsymphony",
  "Strategy Name",
  [
    "if",
    [">", ["current-price", "SPY"], ["moving-average-price", "SPY", {":window": 200}]],
    [["asset", "TQQQ", "Description"]],
    [["asset", "BIL", "Description"]]
  ]
]
```

### Supported Operators

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `if` | Conditional logic | `["if", condition, then_branch, else_branch]` |
| `weight-equal` | Equal weight distribution | `["weight-equal", [branch1, branch2]]` |
| `weight-specified` | Specific weights | `["weight-specified", 0.6, asset1, 0.4, asset2]` |
| `asset` | Individual asset | `["asset", "TQQQ", "Description"]` |
| `group` | Asset grouping | `["group", "TQQQ+SPY", [sub_expression]]` |
| `filter` | Asset filtering | `["filter", ["rsi", {":window": 10}], ["select-top", 1], [assets]]` |

### Supported Indicators

| Indicator | Syntax | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| RSI | `["rsi", "TICKER", {":window": 10}]` | Relative Strength Index |
| Moving Average | `["moving-average-price", "TICKER", {":window": 200}]` | Simple Moving Average |
| Current Price | `["current-price", "TICKER"]` | Current market price |

## Current Performance (Experimental)

- **Parser Accuracy:** 100% against the tested symphony strategy
- **Supported Indicators:** RSI, Moving Average, Current Price (limited set)
- **Supported Operators:** if, weight-equal, weight-specified, asset, group, filter
- **Data Sources:** yfinance for historical data
- **Validation:** CSV-based ground truth comparison
- **Tested Strategy:** [symphony.json](symphony.json) - "TQQQ For The Long Term | reddit version" (sourced from [Composer.trade](https://app.composer.trade/symphony/tZA9DlWahdsFdA4ROkq6/details))

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** The 100% accuracy is achieved only for the specific symphony strategy provided. Other strategies may not work correctly due to limited indicator support and potential bugs.

## Known Limitations & Bugs

### üêõ Current Issues
- **Limited indicator support** - Only 3 indicators implemented (RSI, MA, Current Price)
- **Single strategy tested** - Only validated against [symphony.json](symphony.json)
- **No error handling** - Many edge cases not handled gracefully
- **Memory usage** - Large datasets may cause memory issues
- **Data quality** - No validation of downloaded market data
- **Performance** - Not optimized for large-scale backtesting

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What Doesn't Work
